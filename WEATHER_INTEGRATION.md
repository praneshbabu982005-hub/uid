# Weather Integration

This project now includes a weather feature that displays today's weather information on the left side of the screen when the weather button is clicked.

## Features

- **Weather Button**: Located in the navbar, displays a cloud icon with "Weather" text
- **Weather Widget**: Appears on the left side when clicked, showing:
  - Current temperature
  - Weather condition (Clear, Clouds, Rain, Snow)
  - Humidity percentage
  - Wind speed
  - "Feels like" temperature
  - Last updated timestamp
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to mobile screens
- **Close Button**: Easy to dismiss the weather widget

## Current Implementation

The weather feature currently uses **mock data** for demonstration purposes. The weather information is randomly generated to show the functionality.

## To Integrate with Real Weather API

### Option 1: OpenWeatherMap (Recommended)

1. Sign up for a free account at [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api)
2. Get your API key
3. Update `src/contexts/WeatherContext.js`:

```javascript
// Replace the mock data section with:
const response = await fetch(`${API_URL}?q=${city}&appid=${API_KEY}`);
const data = await response.json();
setWeather(data);
```

### Option 2: WeatherAPI

1. Sign up at [WeatherAPI](https://www.weatherapi.com/)
2. Get your API key
3. Update the API_URL and fetch logic accordingly

### Option 3: AccuWeather

1. Sign up at [AccuWeather Developer Portal](https://developer.accuweather.com/)
2. Get your API key
3. Update the API_URL and response parsing

## Usage

1. Click the weather button (cloud icon) in the navbar
2. The weather widget will appear on the left side
3. Click the X button to close the widget
4. The widget will remember the weather data until the page is refreshed

## File Structure

- `src/contexts/WeatherContext.js` - Weather state management
- `src/components/Weather.js` - Weather display component
- `src/components/Navbar.js` - Updated with weather button
- `src/App.js` - Integrated WeatherProvider and Weather component
- `src/App.css` - Weather widget styles

## Customization

You can customize the weather widget by:
- Modifying the styling in `src/App.css`
- Adding more weather data fields in `src/components/Weather.js`
- Changing the default city in `src/contexts/WeatherContext.js`
- Adding location detection for automatic city selection
